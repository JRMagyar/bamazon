bamazon is a "shopping" app that allows users to select what item and quantity of item they want to purchase from bamazon's list of products stored in a SQL database. When run the user is given a list of all available products and asked to select which they would like to purchase. After selecting a valid product they are prompted to enter a quantity. If they requested quantity of the items is available the products are "sold" and the stock is updated in the database.
